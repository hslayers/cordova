title: Tiled WMS example
shortdesc: Example of a tiled WMS layer.
docs: >
  WMS can be used as a Tile layer, as shown here, or as an Image layer, as shown in the [Single Image WMS example](wms-image.html) example. Tiles can be cached, so the browser will not re-fetch data for areas that were viewed already. But there may be problems with repeated labels for WMS servers that are not aware of tiles, in which case single image WMS will produce better cartography.
